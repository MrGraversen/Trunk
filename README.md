A growing collection of classes I've written and found useful in any degree. I'm (going to be) using this as a base toolbox for most projects; perhaps you may find it of use as well.

## Installation

You may use JitPack to install this from the Github releases.  
Add the following to your `pom.xml` if using Maven:

```
	<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
```

```
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.MrGraversen</groupId>
	    <artifactId>Trunk</artifactId>
	    <version>0.0.1</version>
	</dependency>
```
